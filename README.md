# NinjaBin
A Python Program that scrapes Pastebin using their API and a white-listed IP address.

This is just a side project of mine. You can scrape whatever keywords you want by editing the Array that stores them. 
You can also play with the limit variable in order to Fetch more pastes.

Q: Are unlisted and Private Pastes scrapable?
A: Not with the API.

I don't have a list of TODO's with this program yet, but I have not abandoned the project.

Feature Requests are welcome, just email them to me dreadth@glitch.ninja
